## Task for developers

# Ihor oRlex
1. Make up the header of the site with the top menu (including a drop-down menu at low screen resolutions).
2. Make up section People Are Talking About Fork.

# Nika nIKaaapavs
1. Make up the Revolutionary Editor block. The watch / star / fork buttons on the layout are made in one layer, so you cannot download icons from the layout. The buttons themselves must be made to look like here in the upper right (from there, using the inspector, you can take all the SVG icons and download the styles used on the github).
2. Light up the section Here is what you get.
3. Make up the Fork Subscription Pricing section. In the block with pricing, the third element will always be "selected" and will be larger than the others (that is, not by clicking / hovering, but statically).
